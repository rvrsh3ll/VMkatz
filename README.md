## Too Big to Steal

You are three weeks into a red team engagement. Your traffic crawls through a VPN, then bounces across four SOCKS proxies chained through compromised jump boxes before it touches the target network. Every packet takes the scenic route.

After days of lateral movement you land on a NAS attached to the virtualization cluster and the directory listing hits different: rows upon rows of `.vmdk`, `.vmsn`, `.sav`. Hundreds of gigabytes of virtual machines - domain controllers, admin workstations, the crown jewels - sitting right there.

But your link wheezes at 200 KB/s. Pulling a single 100 GB disk image would take **six days**, and every hour of sustained exfil is another chance the SOC spots the anomaly, burns your tunnel, and the whole chain collapses.

Without VMkatz, the traditional workflow looks like this: exfiltrate the entire VM disk or memory snapshot, mount it locally, install a full Windows analysis stack, load the snapshot into a debugger or use mimikatz on a booted copy, and manually piece together credentials from each VM - one at a time. Multiply that by a dozen VMs on the cluster and you are looking at days of bandwidth, tooling, and post-processing.

VMkatz exists because you shouldn't have to exfiltrate what you can read in place. It extracts Windows secrets - NTLM hashes, DPAPI master keys, Kerberos tickets, cached domain credentials, LSA secrets, NTDS.dit - directly from VM memory snapshots and virtual disks, **on the NAS, the hypervisor, wherever the VM files are**.

A single static binary, ~5 MB. Drop it on the ESXi host, the Proxmox node, or the NAS. Point it at a `.vmsn`, `.vmdk`, or an entire VM folder. Walk away with credentials, not disk images.

## What It Extracts

### From memory snapshots (LSASS)
All 9 SSP credential providers that mimikatz implements:

| Provider | Data | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MSV1_0 | NT/LM hashes, SHA1 | Physical-scan fallback for paged entries |
| WDigest | Plaintext passwords | Linked-list walk + `.data` fallback |
| Kerberos | Passwords, tickets (`.kirbi`) | AVL tree walk, often paged in VM snapshots |
| TsPkg | Plaintext passwords | RDP sessions only |
| DPAPI | Master key cache (GUID + decrypted key) | SHA1 masterkey for offline DPAPI decrypt |
| SSP | Plaintext credentials | `SspCredentialList` in `msv1_0.dll` |
| LiveSSP | Plaintext credentials | Requires `livessp.dll` (rare post-Win8) |
| Credman | Stored credentials | Hash-table + single-list enumeration |
| CloudAP | Azure AD tokens | Typically empty for local-only logon |

### From virtual disks (offline)
- **SAM hashes**: Local account NT/LM hashes
- **LSA secrets**: Service account passwords, auto-logon credentials, machine account keys
- **Cached domain credentials**: DCC2 hashes (last N domain logons)
- **NTDS.dit**: Full Active Directory hash extraction from domain controller disks, natively from the ESE database - no impacket or external tools needed

cargo build --release

# Extract LSASS credentials from a VMware snapshot
./vmkatz snapshot.vmsn

# Same, with pagefile resolution for paged-out creds
./vmkatz --disk disk.vmdk snapshot.vmsn

# Extract SAM/LSA/DCC2 from a virtual disk (auto-detected)
./vmkatz disk.vmdk

# Extract AD hashes from a domain controller disk (NTDS.dit)
./vmkatz --ntds /dev/pve/vm-102-disk-0

# Extract AD hashes with password history
./vmkatz --ntds --ntds-history dc-disk.qcow2

# Point at a VM folder and let it find everything
./vmkatz /path/to/vm-directory/

# List running processes
./vmkatz --list-processes snapshot.vmsn

# Dump LSASS as minidump (for pypykatz, etc.)
./vmkatz --dump lsass -o lsass.dmp snapshot.vmsn

# Output as hashcat-ready hashes (mode 1000)
./vmkatz --format hashcat snapshot.vmsn

# Output as NTLM pwdump format
./vmkatz --format ntlm snapshot.vmsn
```

## Output Formats

| Format | Flag | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `--format text` (default) | Full credential dump with session metadata |
| `ntlm` | `--format ntlm` | `DOMAIN\user:::hash:::` pwdump format |
| `hashcat` | `--format hashcat` | Raw hashes: mode 1000 (NTLM), mode 2100 (DCC2) |
| `csv` | `--format csv` | Machine-readable, all fields |

In `text` mode, well-known blank password hashes (`31d6cfe0...` for NTLM, `aad3b435...` for LM) are annotated with `(blank)`.

Use `--color auto|always|never` to control colored terminal output (default: `auto`, detects TTY). Colors highlight usernames, section headers, interesting hashes, and plaintext passwords.

[*] Providers: MSV(ok) WDigest(ok) ...

[+] Pagefile: 2274 pages resolved from disk
```

## Pagefile Resolution

Memory snapshots only capture physical RAM. Credentials that were paged to disk at snapshot time appear as `(paged out)`. The `--disk` flag reads pagefile.sys from the VM's virtual disk to resolve these.

In **directory mode**, this happens automatically: VMkatz discovers both the snapshot and the disk image, and resolves paged memory without manual flags.

## Deployment on ESXi

VMkatz compiles to a static musl binary that runs directly on ESXi without dependencies:

```bash
# Cross-compile for ESXi (musl static)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Upload (~5 MB)
scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/vmkatz root@esxi:/tmp/

# On ESXi 8.0+, allow non-VIB binaries (requires once)
esxcli system settings advanced set -o /User/execInstalledOnly -i 0

# Extract from a live VM snapshot
/tmp/vmkatz /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/MyVM/MyVM-Snapshot1.vmsn

# Extract SAM from a powered-off VM disk
/tmp/vmkatz /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/MyVM/MyVM-flat.vmdk
```

## Build Features

VMkatz is modular. Features can be enabled/disabled at compile time:

| `sam` | Disk extraction (SAM/LSA/DCC2) and disk format handlers | Yes |
| `ntds.dit` | NTDS.dit AD extraction (`--ntds`, `--ntds-history`). Requires `sam` | Yes |

```bash
# Default build (all hypervisors + disk + NTDS)
cargo build --release

# Memory-only build (no disk handling, smaller binary)
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "vmware vbox qemu hyperv"

# Disk-only build (SAM + NTDS, no memory snapshot support)
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "sam ntds.dit"
```

### Known limitations
- **VBS / Credential Guard**: VMs with Virtualization-Based Security enabled use nested Hyper-V page tables. The VMEM captured by ESXi is 99% zero pages because the actual kernel memory is behind Hyper-V's SLAT. An EPT walker is implemented but cannot yet recover credentials from these VMs. SAM extraction from the virtual disk still works when the VM is powered off.
- **Kerberos**: Kerberos credentials are frequently paged out in VM snapshots. The provider reports `paged` but the data is legitimately absent from RAM. Pagefile resolution (`--disk`) can recover some entries.
- **x86 (32-bit) guests**: Not supported. Only x64 Windows is targeted.

## How It Works

1. **Layer**: Opens the VM snapshot format and exposes guest physical memory as a flat address space. Each hypervisor format (VMware regions, VBox page map, QEMU ELF segments, Hyper-V identity map) is abstracted behind a common `PhysicalMemory` trait.

2. **Process discovery**: Scans physical memory for EPROCESS structures using signature matching (`System\0` at ImageFileName offset) with auto-detection across 6 known offset tables (Win7 through Win11 24H2).

3. **Page table walking**: Translates virtual addresses to physical using the kernel DTB (CR3) with full 4-level page table support. Handles large pages (2MB/1GB), PCID bits, and pagefile fault resolution.

4. **LSASS extraction**: Locates `lsass.exe`, maps its virtual address space, finds DLLs (`lsass.dll`, `msv1_0.dll`, `wdigest.dll`, `kerberos.dll`, etc.) via PEB/LDR enumeration, resolves crypto keys via pattern matching on `.text`/`.data` sections, and decrypts credentials in-memory using 3DES-CBC or AES-CBC (auto-detected by buffer alignment).

5. **Disk extraction**: Parses the virtual disk container (sparse VMDK, VDI, QCOW2, VHDX, VHD), finds the Windows partition (MBR/GPT), walks NTFS MFT to locate `SAM`, `SYSTEM`, `SECURITY` hives, and decrypts hashes using the boot key.

6. **NTDS extraction**: For domain controllers (`--ntds`), locates `NTDS.dit` and the `SYSTEM` hive on disk, then parses the ESE (JET Blue) database natively. Traverses B+ trees to read the `datatable`, extracts the PEK (Password Encryption Key) using the bootkey, and decrypts NT/LM hashes for every AD account. Supports both 8KB pages (Windows Server 2019 and earlier) and 32KB large pages (Windows Server 2025), as well as RC4 (legacy), AES pre-Win2016, and AES Win2016+ (v0x13) hash blob formats.

## Acknowledgements

VMkatz builds on the foundational work of several projects that mapped out Windows credential internals:

- [**mimikatz**](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) by Benjamin Delpy ([@gentilkiwi](https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi)) -- the original Windows credential extraction tool. mimikatz's source code is the definitive reference for LSASS internals: SSP structures, crypto key resolution, credential decryption across Windows versions. VMkatz's 9-provider extraction pipeline follows the architecture Benjamin documented.
- [**pypykatz**](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) by Tamás Jós ([@skelsec](https://twitter.com/skaborern)) -- a pure Python reimplementation of mimikatz credential parsing. pypykatz's clean separation of minidump reading from credential decryption informed VMkatz's design, and its SAM/LSA/DCC2 extraction logic served as a cross-reference for offline registry decryption.
- [**Impacket**](https://github.com/fortra/impacket) by Fortra (originally by Alberto Solino [@agsolino](https://twitter.com/agsolino)) -- the standard Python library for Windows network protocols. Impacket's `secretsdump.py` is the reference implementation for NTDS.dit extraction, SAM dumping, and the pwdump output format that VMkatz's `--format ntlm` follows.
